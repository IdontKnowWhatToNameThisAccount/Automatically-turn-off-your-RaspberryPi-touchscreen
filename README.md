# Automatically-turn-off-your-RaspberryPi-touchscreen

A simple script to automatically turn off the official 7" RasPi touchscreen after a given amount of time. It can be turned on again by any device that can input through the GPIO pins ( e.g. a button or a motion sensor). Touching the screen to turn it on is not possible with this script, as the touch capabilities also get turned off.

I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war or you getting fired because your Raspberry Pi died from connecting the wrong wires. Please do some research if you have any concerns about anything in this script or the How-To-Guide. YOU are choosing to use this script and following the guide, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your Pi, I will laugh at you. Hard & a lot.

If you dircetly connect a 5V GPIO-Pin to any other Pin, even through a button/switch, it will permanently fry your Raspberry Pi. Please dont do that.
